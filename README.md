Old website pages I'm translating and making nicer for fun and education

I put the first batch of files up covering the first lesson. I plan on working on the other lessons sometime next week perhaps. It's slow work and kind of tedious so I don't want to burn out on it. 

I did make a cool function to handle styling. It takes an element that is always one line to get a baseline offsetHeight and uses that to determine if any <p> elements are more than one line long. If they are, they are changed from center alignment to left alignment because it looks better.
